Kozmonot Scope
The software system being produced is called a Live Stream Commerce System. It is being produced for a customer interested in selling different items, like vinyl records, cards, shoes, video games, comics, or clothing via Internet live stream channels. This system is designed to provide enhanced management of the macro and micro business processes uniquely involved in live stream selling channels. The system is built to manage the full life cycle of a product's interaction with both seller and buyer customer types. 

This system is cross-platform and is available to anyone using PCs and mobile devices. The system will be run on a central server with each user having a remote user interface through a web browser to interact with. The platform will not provide internal streaming, rather customers will use external software for streaming capabilities.

For buyers, it will allow them to subscribe to sellers to receive notifications for seller’s live streams, purchase items through live stream events, browse the inventory of sellers, track their purchases, and share their collection and participatory live stream events cross-platforms.

Sellers create the online inventory of all their products they want to sell, manage live stream events, create invoices for buyers, collect payments, track shipping, and build online client groups.
